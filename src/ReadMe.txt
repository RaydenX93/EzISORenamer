Hello there!
This program will help you rename all of your ISO file to match the format required by Open PS2 Loader.

Place this file next to your "DVD" and "CD" folders (the ones you created for OPL), launch the program and sit back.
In a few seconds your ISO library will be correctly renamed.

The program will automatically detect:
- Files that are already named correctly (will be skipped)
- File extensions that are in uppercase (files will be renamed to *.iso instead of *.ISO)
- Filenames that are longer than 32 characters (will be skipped)

From version 1.2, you can also drag and drop iso files or directories containing iso file on the program's icon to process them instantly.

If anything goes wrong, check the log file generated by the program for more details on what happened.

Suggestions, ideas and bug reports are welcome and appreciated. Post them on the forum and let me know (check website at the top of this file).

Enjoy
